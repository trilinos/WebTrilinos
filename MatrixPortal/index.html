  Welcome to the Matrix Portal, a Trilinos-based environment to test and
  experiment with (distributed) sparse linear algebra algorithms. The Matrix
  Portal allows you to generate or upload linear systems, then analyze and
  solve them using preconditioned Krylov accelerators, like CG or GMRES. 
  The available preconditioners are Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, symmetric Gauss-Seidel, several incomplete factorizations, polynomial preconditioners, and smoothed aggregation preconditioners.
The only tool you need
  to use MatrixPortal is a browser: all computations and performed
  on the server, you just specify the problem and the parameters, and wait
  for the results. You don't have to install anything, just play with the
  button and drop-down menus of these web pages.
  <br/><br/>
  
  An overview of the project is as follows: you define a set of linear
  problems and a set of methods to solve them, then you compare the solution
  phases, in order to evaluate (using a criterion you specified) the
  effectiveness of the solution methods. 

  <p>
  MatrixPortal can be used at three different levels.
  If this is the first time you use MatrixPortal, please select 
  <b>beginner</b>. This will guide you through the project,
  and suggest you what to do. If you already know a little bit the ideas behind MatrixPortal,
  select the <b>intermediate</b> level. Otherwise, you can select the
  <b>expert</b> level and drop all the help text.
