<p>You can select one of the linear problems reported in the web page. Data is
stored either in the popular Harwell/Boeing format, or using the
EpetraExt::HDF5 class. Problems may contain a right-hand side, a starting
solution, and an exact solution. If one of the uploaded data is selected, it is
convenient to go to Step 1C to verify the matrix size and the presence of
right-hand side, starting solution and exact solution.
