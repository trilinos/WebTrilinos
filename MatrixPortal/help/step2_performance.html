<h1>Step 2 -- Performance Evaluation</h1>
  
<p>The <b>evaluation parameter</b> is the criterion you will use to evaluate
different solvers. You can select a linear combination of the following: 
<ol>
<li>the CPU time required to build the preconditioner;
<li>the CPU time required to solve the linear system;
<li>the iterations to converge;
<li>the condition number of the preconditioned system. 
This latter option requires either <b>CG with condnum</b> or <b>GMRES
with condnum</b>.
</ol>
