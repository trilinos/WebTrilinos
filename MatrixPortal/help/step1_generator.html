<h1>Step 1 - Data from Generator</h1>
  
The easiest way to define you data is to select one of the problems from the Galeri package of Trilinos. A technical description of this package is available <a
href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/galeri
target=_blank>here</a>. Typically, these problems correspond to
finite difference or finite element discretizations of model problems. At this
point only few of the Galeri problems are supported by MatrixPortal.
