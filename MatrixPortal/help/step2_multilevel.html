<h1>Step 2 -- Multilevel Preconditioners</h1>
  
<p>These preconditioners are implemented by the 
<a href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/ml>ML</a> library, by
class ML_Epetra::MultiLevelPreconditioner, which is available <a target=_blank href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/ml/doc/html/classML__Epetra_1_1MultiLevelPreconditioner.html>here</a>.

<p>ML is Sandia's main multigrid preconditioning package. ML is designed to
solve large sparse linear systems of equations arising primarily from elliptic
PDE discretizations.

<p>If you want to analyze the performances of multigrid preconditioners, first click on
<b>Multilevel Preconditioners</b> to visualize the list of parameters, then set
<b>Analyze Multilevel Preconditioners</b> to <b>Yes</b>. You still need to specify several parameters; probably, the most important ones are the <b>Maximum coarse size</b> and the <b>Smoother type</b> for the different levels. Level 0 is the finest level. 

<p>Typically, you should first try lightweight smoothers on the finest levels (0, 1), and something stronger on the other levels. If this does not suffice, then try a stronger smoothers also for levels 0 and 1.

<p>If the problem is symmetric, <b>Damping factor for aggregation</b> should be 1.333; for highly non-symmetric problems, instead, 0.0 is a safer choice.
