<h1>MatrixPortal -- Workflow</h1>
  
<p>MatrixPortal is structured as a sequence of <b>steps</b>. You can move
   from one step to the next in a linear order (that is, first Step 1, then Step 1C, then Step 2, then Step 3, finally Step 4). Step 1C is an optional step, that is
   helpful to verify your data.
<p>Alternatively, you can move across these steps as shown in the following picture:

<p>Typically, you should first visit step 1 to select your problems, then step 2 to
specify the solution techniques. At this point, you can go to step 3, which 
performs the actual computations. If you want to register the results, you have to 
go to step 4. From step 4, you can either go back to step 1 to define new problems,
or go directly to step 2 to specify new parameters for already specified problems. 

<p>Note that step 3 can be accessed only from step 2, and step 4 can be accessed only from step 3.
