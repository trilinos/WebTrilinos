<h1>Step 2 -- Incomplete Factorization Preconditioners</h1>

<p>These preconditioners are implemented by the 
<a href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/ifpack>IFPACK</a> library, by classes
<a target=_blank href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/ifpack/doc/html/classIfpack__IC.html>Ifpack_IC</a>,
<a target=_blank href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/ifpack/doc/html/classIfpack__ICT.html>Ifpack_ICT</a>,
<a target=_blank href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/ifpack/doc/html/classIfpack__ILU.html>Ifpack_ILU</a>,
<a target=_blank href=http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/dev/packages/ifpack/doc/html/classIfpack__ILUT.html>Ifpack_ILUT</a>.
  
<p>These preconditioners are used for symmetric and positive
definite matrices (IC and ICT), or non-symmetric matrices (ILU and ILUT).
The dropping for IC and ILU factorizations is based on a prescribed pattern,
while ICT and ILUT the dropping is based on element magnitude. Typically, IC
and ILU are faster but less effective than ICT and ILUT. The level-of-fill is
specified by different parameters, so be sure that you are selecting the appropriate one.

If you want to analyze the performances of these preconditioners, first click on
<b>Incomplete Factorization Preconditioners</b> to visualize the list of parameters, then set
to <b>Yes</b> one or more of the following: IC, ICT, ILU, ILUT.
