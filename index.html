<h1>Welcome to WebTrilinos!</h1>

<p>This is the default home page of your personal installation of WebTrilinos.
First, you have to fix a few things, and specify a few installation
parameters. Please follow the links below and the contained instructions.
<ul>
  <li>Check the <a href=common/basic.html>basic requirements</a>.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href=common/setup.html>setup page</a>.</li>
  <li>Check the <a href=common/testing.html>testing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<b>Important note:</b> Remember to add a password protection to the directories 
  <tt>WebTrilinos/c++</tt> and <tt>WebTrilinos/python</tt>! Instructions
on how to do it can be found 
<a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html>here</a>. 
<br>
<p>At this point you can use your installation of WebTrilinos. Currently,
WebTrilinos offers the following three modules:
<ol>
  <li><a href=MatrixPortal/index.html>Matrix Portal</a>: a guided problem
  solving environment (PSE) for the direct and iterative solution of sparse
  linear systems. You can either use already-defined model problems, or upload
  you own problem, in Harwell/Boeing or XML format. MatrixPortal allows you to
  solve an arbitrary number of problems, and each problem can be solved using
  different techniques.
  <li><a href=c++/index.html>The C++ interface</a>: a development
  environment for testing basic Trilinos programs, without having to install
  any Trilinos package. Several basic examples for several Trilinos packages are
  included.
  <li><a href=python/index.html>The Python interface</a>: as for the C++
  interface, but for testing PyTrilinos. Examples of usage of PyTrilinos are
  included.
</ol>
