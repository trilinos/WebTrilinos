<h1>Basic Requirements</h1>

<p>Please check the following:
<ol>
<li>
The first thing you need is an installed (and working!) version of
Trilinos. The following packages must be installed: Teuchos, Epetra,
EpetraExt, Amesos, IFPACK, AztecOO, ML. You also need to enable PyTrilinos by
adding <tt>--enable-python</tt> to your Trilinos configure script. Finally,
you must have installed Trilinos by typing <tt>make install</tt> at the top
Trilinos directory.

<br>
<br>
<li><b>IMPORTANT</b>: You probably want to add a password protection to the directories 
  <tt>WebTrilinos/c++</tt> and <tt>WebTrilinos/python</tt>! Instructions
on how to do it can be found 
<a href=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/auth.html>here</a>. The
MatrixPortal module can be left without protections, depending on your needs.
<br>
<br>
<li>
You need PHP installed on your system. PHP must process both <tt>.php</tt> and
<tt>.html</tt> files. The line below should not contain any <tt>&lt;?</tt> or
<tt>?&gt;</tt>. If it does, check your web server installation, to be sure
that PHP takes care of <tt>.html</tt> as well.

<P>
<font color=blue>
<? echo "Simple test for PHP!"; ?>
</font>

<br>
<br>
<li>
<p>You need <tt>convert</tt> installed on your system. Below you have the
location of <tt>convert</tt> as defined by <tt>/bin/env</tt>.
<p>
<font color=blue>
  <? passthru("echo /bin/env convert"); ?>. 
</font>
<p>If nothing is found, then you
will not be able to plot the sparsity pattern in the MatrixPortal module.

<br>
<br>
<li>You need PyChart to plot results in the MatrixPortal module. If you don't
have it, you can still WebTrilinos, but without
graphs in the MatrixPortal module. PyChart can be downloaded at the web page
<a href=http://home.gna.org/pychart/>http://home.gna.org/pychart/</a>.  Below
you have the output of <tt>python -c "from pychart import *"</tt>. If nothing
is reported, PyChart is correctly installed on your system.
<br>
<? passthru("python -c 'from pychart import *'"); ?>
</ol>

<br>
<br>
Go to the <a href=setup.html>setup</a> page, or go back to the
<a href="../index.html">home page</a>.
